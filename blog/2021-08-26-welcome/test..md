# Markdown page math example

Test math:

Let $f\colon[a,b]\to\R$ be Riemann integrable. Let $F\colon[a,b]\to\R$ be
$F(x)=\int_{a}^{x} f(t)\,dt$. Then $F$ is continuous, and at all $x$ such that
$f$ is continuous at $x$, $F$ is differentiable at $x$ with $F'(x)=f(x)$.

- a possible model is assigning equally likely alignment probability
  $\quad p(a|e,m)=\frac{1}{(l+1)^m}$
- and the conditional translation model is
  $\quad p(f|a,e,m) = \prod_{j=1}^m t(f_{j|e_{a_{j}}})$
- Example calculation
