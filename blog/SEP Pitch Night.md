- 5 min pitch, 3 min Q&A
## Sync
- power to freeze time?
- good hook, but make the point earlier?
	- primary vs secondary goals
	- calendar app could be more straightforward
- calendar for must vs want todos
- sync w gcal
- spotlight-like command bar
- MVP is gpt-4? 25 users? not too bad
- freemium
### Questions
- using gpt-4 to generate events?
	- defensibility answer not super satisfactory, moat: different calendar integrations
### Feedback
- overpromising hook, dissapointing solution
- motion designs
## fig
- problem: customer retention
- customer retention pipeline
- create a pass on someone’s apple wallet
- pass → scan pass → discount → pass is voided
- dashboard for pass on apple wallet
### Feedback
- almost an overglorified e-stamps feature but with analytics
	- cannot grab square users !important
- clutter of apps/inbox transferred to → clutter of cards
- I actually like it
	- easy rewards system anyway
	- I would personally make this tradeoff → don’t need to make app
- make it possible for a lot of small shops
- business model not the best
- who exactly are the competitors? need to define clearly based on features & capabilities
## Lex
- legal writing sucks
- love Michael
- 95% of small law firms are what?
- brief writing
- research → analyze facts → make connections → write argument → takes days
	- small firms compete on price
- tool that visually represents all case-related documents → good one-liner
	- software generates mind map
- phase I and II
- nice business model
- SEP-esque design?
- 20% of 1 hour per client
### Questions
- who are your competitors?
	- how is it being done now? why is it lacking?
	- why mindmap? why not like using AI to summarize?
- 100+ page → mindmap? how effective is this actually?
	- gives an impression of like *I don’t believe it*
	- where is the user flow?
- possible feature: ask chat what am I missing?
### Feedback
- small nit: let us know if the law firms you’re working with happens to not be your dad
## Clinicode
- love the intro, hooked straight away
	- wait stuck on 1 slide for too long?
- beautiful beautiful beautiful demo
### Questions
- how do you deal with insurance and legal issues
- are you actually gonna run videos during pitch night?
- you have your own model?
- what happens when a code doesn’t appear in your top K lists
	- what if confidence level is ~50%?
- great ending
### Feedback
- Clinicode is also based on volume
- OpenAI embeddings + semantic search is not an ML model → RAG
- demo would be nice Sam Altman style
- Xpert coding and other competitors
- price not justified → someone will come in and lowball
	- not sticky or anything, not storing data due to HIPAA, low operating cost can’t justify high asking price
## OPAL
- simplifying authentic travel experiences
- very greedy business model
	- maybe just do the b2b side?
- don’t say *if just 1% that is too hypothetical*
- nice traction
### Feedback
- app not working
- some ranking system? need to have a niche or gamified feature
- also who are biggest competitors? I would rather have 1 or 2 competitors than nobody
