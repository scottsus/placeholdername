## NORA CMOS Logic
- otherwise known as NP-Domino logic
- Idea: dynamic logic stages that also use pmos transistors
	1. when clock is low:
		nmos output nodes are precharged to $V_{DD}$ through pmos precharge devices
		pmos output nodes are pre-discharged to 0V through nmos discharge transistor
	2. when clock low ‚Üí high:
		all cascaded nmos and pmos logic stages evaluate one after another

- example

- Advantages:
	- static cmos inverter not required at output of every dynamic logic stage
		- pmos handles 1 ‚Üí 0, nmos handles 0 ‚Üí 1
	- instead of dynamic ‚Üí static ‚Üí dynamic ‚Üí static, we get dynamic ‚Üí dynamic ‚Üí dynamic
	- allows **pipelined system architecture**
### Zipper CMOS Circuits
- zipper technique overcomes dynamic charge sharing & soft-node leakage problems
- identical to NORA CMOS, but requires generation of slightly different clock signals for precharge/discharge transistors and for pullup/pulldown transistors
	- signal $\chi=V_{DD}-V_{T0,p}$
	<Image src="/attachments/IMG-20231211155905.png" alt="Image"/>
- clock signals allow precharge/discharge transistors to remain in weak conduction or near cutoff during eval, compensating for charge leakage & charge sharing problems
### True Signal-Phase Clock (TSPC) Dynamic CMOS
- TSPC uses 1 clock, never inverted ‚Üí no clock skew
- higher clock frequency ‚è∞üëç

- Consider the circuit shown above:
	- when clock is low, output of N-block is precharged to $V_{DD}$
	- when clock low ‚Üí high, logic stage output evaluated, output latch generates valid output level
	- when clock is high, P-block pre-discharges and evaluates when clock is low
- compared to NORA CMOS, we need 2 more transistors per stage, but ability to operate with a true single-phase clock signal is attractive
