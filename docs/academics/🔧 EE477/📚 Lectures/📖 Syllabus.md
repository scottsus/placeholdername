## Description
This course provides an introduction to analysis and design of digital MOS VLSI circuits including area, delay, and power minimization. The course explores the design aspects involved in the realization of CMOS integrated circuits from device up to the register level. The course includes the study of the MOS devices, logic cells, and critical interconnect and cell characteristics that determine the performance of VLSI circuits. Students will use CAD tools to develop efficient circuit layouts and verify designs. Laboratory assignments include design, layout, extraction, and simulation. As part of the final project students design a full-custom FSM.

## Goals
### Full Custom ASIC Design Skills
The main goal of this class is to practice the basics steps of ASIC full-custom design flow, from specification down to layout, and develop the necessary hardware and software skills for it. In addition to design steps, the flow includes optimization and verification steps and they are partly practiced in this course. We will also cover the basic concepts of the CMOS technologies, and also memories.
### Job Referrals
I will announce any opportunities I am told by my industry contacts, including my former students. You may check the announcement page for that. For each announcement, email me your resume if interested. I would most likely not get enough time to reply to you, but I would certainly see all emails/resumes for each announcement and forward the resumes.
Almost all our HW/Lab/Project tasks are designed to help you prepare for interviews.
I will provide you with a lot of tips during lectures and if necessary, my office hours. I encourage you to participate in our  lecture Q/A  [will ask you questions that were interview questions, or questions that I believe may appear in the future as a potential interview problem]. I believe your participation will enhance the skills you'd need to nail an interview.
### Research & Startup
For those interested I will help you develop skills necessary to conduct research, and tackle open-ended problems. This would help you envision opportunities to establish your own startup in the future. This part is optional and to encourage the class for it, we will have a lot extra credit tasks aiming for this goal item. This would also help those students who plan to pursue their studies towards a Ph.D. degree.
## Expectations
1. Stay covid-free and [safe](https://campusactivities.usc.edu/getting-around-the-neighborhood-safely/).
2. Follow the [Academic Integrity Policies](https://blackboard.usc.edu/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=%7BorgUnitId%7D&type=content&rcode=uscviterbi-205403) of USC and this course.
3. Attend lecture and discussion classes. Note that it is mandatory to attend every lecture and discussion session. You are welcome to attend any lecture session, regardless of which section you registered.
4. Take notes during lecture/discussion sessions.
5. Turn off your electronics, unless you are using them to take lecture/discussion notes. Avoid distracting your classmates during lectures/discussions.
6. Participate in discussions by asking questions and providing answers/arguments.
7. Aim to top the class. Please keep in mind that everyone in class receives the same amount of information, assignments and exam problems. Therefore, think of our class as a competition, like interview processes, where you aim to top the class, no matter how challenging the class or exams are.
8. Review any posted material in advance to the corresponding lecture. This would greatly aid your comprehension of the course material.
9. Do all the mandatory assignments. Having done the mandatory parts, if you have additional time and interest, approach at least some of the extra credit parts.
10. Since I was asked during previous semesters, please be respectful of your peers by being quiet during lectures. Talk only if you are participating in the Q/A of class monitored by the TA or myself. Also avoid bringing to class, any food that smells strongly!  You are welcome to stand or walk anywhere in class, if it helps you better concentrate; as video seems to have not created issues before, but audio/odor did!!
11. I try to avoid sending too many emails, according to what my previous semester students wanted. Instead, I try to post announcements, notes and updates on the course website. Please check the course website regularly including checking for updates. Any updates on assignments, lectures, etc., would be time stamped (E.g.: Last Update: 11/27/2022 @ 8:22am).
## General Homework Guidelines
1. Please use a tablet to **handwrite** your answers (except for the coding parts) and submit a pdf. Alternatively, please use paper and pencil/pen to write your answer on paper and then scan (take a picture of) your paper and submit as a pdf file. Think of hand-writing HWs as an effective practice for our exams which are paper-based.
2. The grader will NOT grade any submissions with typed answers. Once again (1) and (2) mean that any non-code part should be hand-written, not typed.
3. Coding parts and code descriptions (i.e., comments) of HWs should be typed and submitted as a softcopy (so we can compile the code). Also the description of how the code works, can be typed. We prefer that description to appear in the code itself as a set of comments.
4. Coding parts - Naming convention: The typed code and any testing/result files that are asked for, should be submitted in separate files, e.g., HW2-Q1-Part3.cpp. Please also provide us with a readme.pdf file that includes all the info you'd like us (the grader to know), e.g., your assumptions, I/O format, non-working parts, any instructions on how to run or test your code.
5. All the HW files (i.e., the code/test/result files, and the pdf files) should be submitted on website. It helps the grader to submit the files unzipped.
6. Solutions for the mandatory parts and no-submit parts of HWs would be provided. However solutions for the extra credit may not be provided, especially if the problem is open-ended with no unique answer.
7. To follow Academic Integrity policies of our course and USC, you should state the resources (online, book, paper). The citations should be done carefully and clearly, e.g.: “to write my code, lines 27 to 65, I used the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm code from the following website: [www.SampleWebsite.com/](http://www.SampleWebsite.com/) ... or I copied the solution to this HW problem from the following research paper...[then cite the paper].”  The citations can be typed.
8. A reminder that all the mandatory parts are directly discussed during lectures. Please therefore use the lectures to provide the answers.
9. The optional parts are no submit, but not studying them may negatively impact your exam grades. They may note the total number of points per problem. That may be useful for exam preparation (how much each part is worth) but does not imply you should submit for them.
### Extra Credit Parts
1. We are going to be very strict in grading the extra credit parts (in the assignments, and exams). As part of the strict grading, we look at novelty, uniqueness, level of difficulty, and creativity. Any average work would get minimal points. Exceptionally strong submissions would get a large portion of total. Similar submisisons would get a small portion (if checked to not have any academic integrity (ai) issues - for any ai related consequences please refer to the ai part of syllabus).
2. Any references (books, online resources, etc.) should be cited very clearly. As long as cited, you would be safe as far as AI policies are concerned.
3. The extra credit parts are **NOT** part of our course, but designed to help you better prepare for **job opportunities**, e.g., on those that demand skills that are **beyond** what our course can offer. One important aspect of extra credit parts is their open-ended nature. This is partly to address the feedback we receive from industry. My industry contacts (at Google, Apple, etc.) have informed me that many of our students cannot solve problem during an interview, if it is open-ended.
4. Extra credit parts are generally challenging, open-ended and beyond the course's main requirements. This also means that most likely we would not get time to cover them in class, but if interested you would work on those on your own with minimal guidance from the TAs and myself.
5. Word of caution: Best strategy: take care of mandatory parts first (check _Expectations posted under the Syllabus_), and attempt for the extra credit only if you are very confident about those parts; and then if you have plenty of extra time, and a great amount of passion for the extra credit topic, attempt for it.
## General Lab Guidelines
1. For each lab, you should write a README file, named `readme.pdf` (or name it according to the assignments naming instructions if any). A README file typically contains information of students’s name, USC student ID, and email, a brief program summary, references and instructions. Besides, include any information that you think the course staff, especially the grader should know while grading your assignment: references, any non‐working part, any concerns, etc including:
    1. Any non‐working part should be clearly stated.
    2. To avoid any issue related to Academic Integrity Policies of this course and USC (Posted under the Syllabus), you should state the resources (online, book, paper). The citations should be done carefully and clearly, e.g.: “to write my code, lines 27 to 65, I used the Diijkstra's shortest path algorithm C++ code from the following website: [www.SampleWebsite.com/](http://www.SampleWebsite.com/) ...lines x to y”
    3. The Readme file content of labs should not be hand‐written and should only be typed.
2. Please
    1. Name all your files as specified by the assignment and precede all the file names by your student ID. E.g., for a student with ID 851112055, the Astar2D.cpp should be named `851112055Astar2D.cpp`
    2. Try your best to make your codes clear and readable. If your program cannot pass the test and the code is hard to read as well, you will get low grades.
3. We generally do not provide a solution for the labs, because the solution to lab assignments is not unique and we know from our previous experiences that posting a sample code, would at times mislead, instead of helping students. Instead, check your own code. If it's working, then that is good, but always try to look for more optimization on your code with guidance from the instructor, TA/mentor, or discussion forums. If your code does not work, show it to the TA/mentor to see if they have any comments to help you debug.
4. We generally do not get a chance to debug your code, because debugging takes a long time and goes beyond our office hours, and that usually there are other students waiting during office hours. In any case, during our office hours we will try our best to give you some tips and suggestions on how to debug.
## General Project Guidelines
1. The final project (like HW and Lab assignments) is based on individual effort. Therefore no collaborations (no discussions, no sharing code among students) are allowed. You may refer to the syllabus to review the academic honesty policies, including the penalties of violating them. Any questions or doubts about what is cheating and what is not, should be referred to the instructor or the TA.
2. It will be in multiple phases for your better time management. However all mandatory phases may be graded together to maximize fairness (e.g. to more reasonably grade the errors that were fixed in a following phase).
3. Any references (pieces of code you find online, etc.) used, should be clearly cited in the `readme.txt` file that you will submit with your code.
4. Demo is necessary for the extra credit part. Demo for mandatory parts may be waived if the TAs find out the work can be graded without an demo. We may therefore pick some students to demonstrate their design and simulations.
5. Post your questions on project discussion forum. You are encouraged to participate in the discussions. It may be helpful to review all the questions posted by other students and the answers.
## Exam Guidelines
1. Exam 1 & Exam 2: 90 minutes
2. Quiz 1 & Quiz 2: 30 minutes during lecture
3. Closed exams, no makeup
4. You would be asked questions that test your understanding of concepts that were covered during our lecture or discussion sections.
5. I am very lenient towards any requests and would try my best to help you, however I need to warn you that if you get caught cheating during exam (or on any assignments) the committee that watches my course grading and submissions, would forward the case to SJACS office. Most likely the consequences would be severe to a level that could impact your academic and professional life permanently. The minimum penalty for cheating during exam would be an F as your grade plus other penalties that would be decided and executed by SJACS and school. Please note that if you get caught, there is little I could do to help you out. I can try to ask for reducing the recommendation, but based on my prior experience, the case goes through a routine, with almost zero chance, the instructor or any other individual could intervene.
